Voice: Wake up Larry!
Larry ignores the voice.
Larry: Who are you?
The voice ignores Larry.
Larry: Hello?? Why are you ignoring me?
The Voice: I am an American Idol rip off.
Larry: Huh? Am I dreaming.
Voices: We will take you on the adventure of a lifetime Larry!
Larry listened to the voices as he was taken back to his youth.
Larry: Where am I?
The voice ignores Larry.
Larry: Hello??
Voice: Sorry, I almost fell asleep too. 
Voice: You are back in your youth. You've sure gained weight.
Larry: Who am I?
Build A Bear: You are the voice, my little Larry.
Larry: Noooo! Not you! I've been avoiding you since I was 5!
Build A Bear: You can't escape your mind my little midget.
Voice: How many times do I have to tell you that I'm not a midget?
Zebra Man: I don't know, but I do know that this isn't a dream.
Larry: Okay. What the spicy lemonade is going on here?
Zebra Man: How can I put this nicely to you Larry? Umm. Your brain is slowly falling apart.
Larry: It's what!?!?!?!
Zebra Man: Yeah, ever since you got food poisoning from that taco vendor, you haven't acted the same.
Build A Bear: No, Larry isn't crazy. Larry is the smartest henchman I have ever met.
Larry: Wait a second, where did you two come from?
Gator Jill: Who, me?
Larry: Oh no, not another one.

Everyone: Larry the Zookeeper!
After over a twelve hour nap, Larry finally wakes up.
